---
**Note** The rescue exercise will start in Wookey Hole chamber 22, which is only accessible by divers, but dry cavers will be required during the exercise, to assist with hauling and stretcher carrying to the surface. One of the areas that the exercise will focus on is the co-operation between the diving and non-diving rescuers.

### Sunday Presentations

#### Medical Session (led by Brendan Sloan, DCRO)

Brendan Sloan is the BCRC Medical Officer, and will be leading a series of shorter presentations to cover a number of medical related topics, including

  * Lessons Learnt from Curtain Pot Incident
  * Update from BCRC Medical Weekend
  * New BCRC Medical Training Equipment

#### Livestock and Animal Rescue (Julian Carter, SMWCRT)

[South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team](http://www.smwcrt.org/j32/) have been involved in a number of animal or livestock rescue incidents recently, some of which have been prolonged and high profile. Julian Carter will be discussing how SMWCRT deal with animal rescue, and will include a showing of a recent sequence shot for the BBC programme [Kate Humble: Off the Beaten Track](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09h78rq) where they rescue the presenters sheep dog "Teg" from a disused mineshaft.

#### BCRC Online Incident Reporting (Richard Vidler, SECRO)

Richard Vidler will be discussing the recently developed [BCRC On-line Incident Reporting](https://incident.bcrc.uk/) tool, including how to use it to record any incidents that cave rescue teams have been involved in, and what is planned for future releases.

#### SARCALL

#### Challenging Rescue Scenarios (Simon Flower, MCR)

Most cave rescue incidents are, fortunately, relatively straightforward for the local cave rescue team to handle. However, there are a few rare occasions when there is a serious injury to a caver in a challenging cave where the rescue is anything but straightforward. Simon Flower will lead a "table top" session, where there will be discussion around how a team should handle such a scenario. The scenario used for the discussion will be local to Mendip, but the points raised by the discussion will be applicable to rescues from challenging caves in other cave rescue team areas.

### Sunday Practical Sessions

#### Evacuation of an Injured Diver (starting from Wookey Hole Chamber 22)

A full scale rescue exercise, with the extraction of an injured diver from [Wookey Hole](https://www.wookey.co.uk/) chamber 22 through a sump and then carried out the surface. The start of the exercise will require diving cave rescuers (beyond the sump) and non-diving cave rescuers (to rig a haul line to manoeuvre the injured diver out of the water). A full briefing will be made on the morning of the exercise, but this exercise will be an excellent opportunity for non-diving cave rescuers to understand aspects of a diving rescue scenario.

#### Underground Communication (Sludge Pit Hole)

A session with the various underground to surface communication systems that are currently available to cave rescue teams, including the [cave link](http://www.cavelink.com/cl3x_neu/index.php/en/) text messaging system, the [Nicola 3](http://www.caverescue.org.uk/nicolaradio/) radio system (running the latest firmware), and the original [HeyPhone](http://bcra.org.uk/creg/heyphone/) and micro-heyphone. This session will have some people underground and some people on the surface. Note that Sludge Pit Hole has a short ladder just inside the entrance, which will be rigged for the weekend, and those going underground will require a belay belt or suitable harness.

This session is a repeat of the session held on Saturday.

### Sunday Other Sessions

#### Lyon Equipment demonstrations and kit discussions

[Lyon Equipment](https://lyon.co.uk/) will have a display area with the ability to show, demonstrate and discuss items of kit close up with people throughout the weekend, including a quad-pod and tri-pod, basket stretcher and a full range of small items.
