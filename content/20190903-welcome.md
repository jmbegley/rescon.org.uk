Summary: Welcome to Priddy

Welcome to Priddy, in the centre of the Mendip Hills.

Cavers, and cave divers, have been coming to Priddy for many years, with [Mendip Cave Rescue (MCR)](https://www.mendipcaverescue.org) proud to be the second oldest cave rescue organisation (formed just a year after the [Cave Rescue Organisation](https://www.cro.org.uk)) and the [Cave Diving Group (CDG)](https://cavedivinggroup.org.uk) also undertaking a lot of early dives in nearby Wookey Hole.

## ResCon Information

ResCon is based at [Ebborways Farm](https://ebborwaysfarm.co.uk/camp-site/), a basic campsite on the edge of Priddy. ResCon has a separate field, set back from the road. The campsite is equipped with water taps and we have arranged for some toilet facilities to be installed on site for the weekend. There are no showers or electric hookups on site, although is you want a shower then there are a number of caving huts a short distance away where a hot shower can be found.

ResCon will be centred around a marquee, to be found on your left as you enter the field, and most activities on site will be based in the marquee. Beyond the marquee there will be a smaller, but just as important, tent that contains the bar for the weekend. On the right as you enter the field will be a reception and registration tent.

ResCon will be an event with wristbands, and all delegates will be given a wristband when they arrive and check in. The wristband will be used to demonstrate to the catering and bar staff that you have bought a ticket. The wristbands should survive a couple of short caving trips, but if you have problem then please return to the registration tent and you will be issued with a replacement.

Practical sessions will be located in a number of local caves, with a number of sessions based at [Wookey Hole](https://www.wookey.co.uk), a showcave based just down the hill from the campsite. Wookey Hole have kindly allowed us to make use a number of areas within the showcave. Please note that to give us an indication of numbers, there will be sign-up sheets for all the practical sessions in the registration tent.

Information about the ResCon weekend can be downloaded as a [conference booklet]({static}/files/ResconBooklet.pdf).
