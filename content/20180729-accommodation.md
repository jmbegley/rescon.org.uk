Summary: ResCon accommodation

## ResCon 19 Accommodation

There will be plenty of space to camp on site with basic facilities (toilets and washing facilities only). Please note that the price of the entry tickets will include food for the weekend so that there will be no need to cook. Sleeping in campervans will also be possible, but there will be no electric hookup facility available.

## Other Accommodation

We appreciate that not everyone would like to camp on site, and so there are a number of alternatives. A small number of campervan pitches with electric hookup will be available nearby (please contact [James](mailto:james@rescon.org.uk) if you wish to use these). Alternatively there are three caving club huts within walking distance - these are (in order of distance from the site) [Wessex Cave Club (WCC)](https://wessex-cave-club.org), [Bristol Exploration Club (BEC)](https://www.bec-cave.org.uk) and [Shepton Mallet Caving Club (SMCC)](https://www.shepton.org.uk). Please contact the clubs directly to make a booking for the weekend if you would like to stay in one of the huts.
