## What is the BCRC?

The [British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC)](https://www.caverescue.org.uk) was formed in 1967 as the representative body for bona fide volunteer underground rescue organisations in the British Isles. Its functions include representing and supporting its members at National and International level, promoting the exchange of information between member rescue organisations and providing a common voice for them. It is a coordinating and not a governing body. Individual cave rescue organisations remain entirely autonomous and independent.

## What is ResCon?

ResCon is the bi-annual BCRC Cave Rescue Conference, a gathering of cave rescue volunteers (and others) to discuss (and practice) cave rescue techniques and meet other cave rescue team members. The next ResCon is to be held on Mendip in September 2019, to be organised by [Mendip Cave Rescue (MCR)](https://www.mendipcaverescue.org), the local voluntary cave rescue service.

## When is the next ResCon?

The next ResCon is ResCon 19, to be held over the weekend of 6th to the 8th September 2019 on the outskirts of Priddy in the Mendips. Full details will be available on this website shortly.

## Who are organising ResCon 19?

The next ResCon is to be organised by [MCR](https://www.mendipcaverescue.org), with [James Begley](mailto:james@rescon.org.uk) taking on the role of conference coordinator, ably assisted by other MCR rescue wardens.
