## ResCon 19 Expenses

### LIBOR Funding

The British Cave Rescue Council has successfully applied for [LIBOR](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/libor-funding-applications) funding to cover part of the cost of the ResCon weekend. The LIBOR funding will cover up to 80% of the total cost, provided it meets certain criteria - for example, travel and subsistence for training events.

### Travel expenses

One area where BCRC has successfully applied for LIBOR funding is to cover travel costs. We are pleased to announce that BCRC will be able to refund 80% of attendees travel costs, when attendees complete the [BCRC travel claim form]({static}/files/BCRCexpensesclaimform.xlsx). A paper copy of the travel claim form will be available over the weekend, but it may be easier if you download and fill in the electronic version before hand. The BCRC treasurer will be attending ResCon weekend and so will be able to help with any questions that may arise from completing this form.
